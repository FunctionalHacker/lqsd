= LiQuid Screen Dim

A simple utility which dims your screen. It saves the previous
brightness too, so you can restore to the point before dimming.

This is useful if you are running a standalone screen locking setup like
swayidle/swaylock. Check out
https://git.korhonen.cc/FunctionalHacker/dotfiles/src/branch/master/home/.config/sway/scripts/idle.sh[my
configuration files] for an example use case.

== Usage

[source]
----
USAGE:
    lqsd [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -d, --dim            Dims the screen to idle level set in configuration
    -r, --resume         Sets the backlight to the value it was before dimming
        --copy-config    Copies the default config file to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lqsd
    -h, --help           Prints help information
    -V, --version        Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    --config <FILE>      Sets a custom config file
----

The configuration file resides at `~/.config/lqsd/config.toml`. To copy
the default configuration file in place, you can use `--copy-config`.

In the configuration file you can set the following values:

[width="100%",cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
|Key|Explanation|Default

|resume_file
|The location where the previous brightness is saved
|/tmp/lqsd-resume

|idle_level
|The minimum brightness that will be dimmed to. Can be a value between 0-100
|0

|dim_speed
|This sets the "sleep time" between each backlight command. Itâ€™s in milliseconds
|50

|resume_speed
|Same as dim_speed, but for the resume operation `-r`
|25

== Installation

=== Dependencies

The only external dependency is
https://github.com/haikarainen/light[light].

=== Building

Clone this repository and run `cargo build --release` inside the project
to compile a static binary.

=== Arch Linux

So far, I have only packaged this for Arch Linux. Packages are in
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=lqsd[AUR].

To install it, use your favorite AUR helper, yay for example:

[source,nosyntax]
----
yay -S lqsd
----

Select if you want to [1] build from source [2] install a precompiled
binary:

[source,nosyntax]

:: Repository AUR
    1) lqsd 2) lqsd-bin

Enter a number (default=1):

== Releases

Release notes and binaries can be found either in
https://git.korhonen.cc/FunctionalHacker/lqsd/releases[My Git server] or
https://github.com/FunctionalHacker/lqsd/releases[GitHub].

== Why Rust?

I wanted start a small project to learn Rust. Before lqsd, I was using
https://github.com/Bonnee/dotfiles/blob/wayland/scripts/bin/dim.sh[this
script] and figured, why not rewrite it in Rust.

== Mirrors

This repository lives at
https://git.korhonen.cc/FunctionalHacker/lqsd[My Git server], but it is
also mirrored to https://github.com/FunctionalHacker/lqsd[GitHub] and
